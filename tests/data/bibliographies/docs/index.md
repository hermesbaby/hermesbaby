# Some thoughts

Some thoughts about Wilbur Smith, docs-as-code and Software and Systems Engineering.

First we have a look at each of the three topics separately, then we will see how they are connected.

## Wilbur Smith

Wilbur Smith is a prolific author of adventure novels, often set in Africa. He has written over 30 books, many of which have been bestsellers. His writing style is known for its vivid descriptions and fast-paced storytelling.

Three of his most popular novels are:

- {cite:p}`smith1966soundthunder`
- {cite:p}`smith1993rivergod`

## Docs-as-code

Docs-as-code is a documentation approach that treats documentation as a first-class citizen in the software development process. It emphasizes the use of version control, continuous integration, and automation to create and maintain documentation. This approach allows for better collaboration between developers and technical writers, and it helps ensure that documentation is always up-to-date with the codebase.

Some precious resources on docs-as-code include:

- {cite:p}`microsoftMaintainAdr`
- {cite:p}`mannWahrenberg2025`

## Software and Systems Engineering

Software and Systems Engineering is a discipline that focuses on the design, development, and maintenance of software systems. It encompasses a wide range of activities, including requirements analysis, software architecture, coding, testing, and deployment. The goal of Software and Systems Engineering is to create high-quality software that meets the needs of users and stakeholders.

## Connections

While Wilbur Smith's novels may not seem directly related to docs-as-code or Software and Systems Engineering, there are some interesting connections to be made. For example, the process of writing a novel can be seen as a form of software development, where the author is the developer and the novel is the product. In this sense, Wilbur Smith's writing process could be compared to the docs-as-code approach, where the author is constantly iterating and improving their work.

Additionally, the themes of adventure and exploration in Wilbur Smith's novels could be seen as a metaphor for the challenges and opportunities that arise in Software and Systems Engineering. Just as the characters in his novels face obstacles and discover new territories, software engineers must navigate complex systems and find innovative solutions to problems.

Overall, while Wilbur Smith's novels may not be directly related to docs-as-code or Software and Systems Engineering, they can still provide valuable insights and inspiration for those working in these fields. By drawing connections between seemingly unrelated topics, we can gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise in software development and documentation.
